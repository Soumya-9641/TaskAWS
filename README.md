## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Soumya-9641/TaskAWS
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  first change all environment variable(mongodb url)
  add .env file
  write your postgresql connection variables(USER HOST DATABASE PASSWORD DB_PORT JWT_TOKEN)
  connect that url at connection.js file
  npm install
  nodemon app.js
```
```

## Deployment
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Soumya-9641/TaskAWS
```
```bash
First Create A AWS RDS of postgresql engine

 - Log in to the AWS Management Console and search for â€˜RDSâ€™. You will be redirected to the RDS Home Page.
 - Click on the â€˜Create Databaseâ€™ button and select â€˜PostgreSQLâ€™.
 - In the â€˜DB Instance Settingsâ€™ section, specify the following:

    Password
 - Click on the â€˜Saveâ€™ button to save the server configuration
 - You should now be able to connect to your PostgreSQL DB instance using pgAdmin.
```
```bash
Now create Elastic Beanstalk with the hosted Aws RDS url
    - Once the RDS instance is created, note down the Endpoint URL.
    - Go to your env file and replace HOST value from localhost to rds url.
    - Rename your entry point as 'app.js'.
    - In your package.json file rename your 'start' script as 'node app.js'
    - Now create a Procfile and  in Procfile write one script as 'web: npm start'.
    - delete the node_modules and create a .zip file for other files.
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and log in.
    - Click on the Elastic Beanstalk service.
    - Click on the Create a 'New Application' button.
    - Choose 'Web server environment' and give an application name
    - choose the platform as 'nodejs' and at 'Application code' choose 'upload your code' and upload your .zip file
    - Next choose a EC2 instance profile
    - keep next everything then come to 'Configure updates, monitoring, and logging' option and add all environment variable you code contains
    - Now 'Submit' it and it will successfully deployed your app.
